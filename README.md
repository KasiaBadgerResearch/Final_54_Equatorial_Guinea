# How have the shares of liquid liabilities, central bank assets, and financial system deposits relative to GDP evolved in Equatorial Guinea between 1985 and 2019?

## Abstract

Using World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI) data, this study examines the evolution of key financial sector indicators in Equatorial Guinea between 1985 and 2019, focusing on liquid liabilities, central bank assets, and financial system deposits relative to GDP. These indicators provide insight into the structure, depth, and stability of the country’s financial system. Over the period, all three measures declined, reflecting both macroeconomic shifts and structural changes in financial intermediation. Liquid liabilities and central bank assets decreased significantly, suggesting reduced reliance on broad monetary aggregates and a possible contraction of central bank interventions relative to the economy. Financial system deposits fell more modestly, indicating that deposit mobilization within commercial banks remained somewhat resilient despite broader contractions. At the beginning of the period, liquid liabilities and central bank assets were more than twice the size of financial system deposits, highlighting a concentrated financial system dominated by monetary authority measures and limited bank intermediation. By 2019, the three indicators had converged closely, reflecting a more balanced financial structure and reduced disparities between liquidity, central bank activity, and deposit mobilization. The overall trajectory shows a long-term contraction across monetary and financial measures alongside convergence, suggesting that Equatorial Guinea’s financial system evolved toward greater equilibrium between liquidity, central bank interventions, and deposit-based intermediation. These patterns offer a lens into the country’s financial development, highlighting both the challenges of monetary management and the gradual adaptation of the banking sector in supporting economic growth and stability.

## 1. Question

How have the shares of liquid liabilities, central bank assets, and financial system deposits relative to GDP evolved in Equatorial Guinea between 1985 and 2019?

- **Liquid liabilities proxy**: Liquid liabilities (% of GDP)
- **Central bank assets proxy**: Central bank assets (% of GDP)
- **Financial system deposits proxy**: Financial system deposits (% of GDP)

## 2. Data

- **Source**: World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)
- **Indicators**:
  - Liquid liabilities (% of GDP)
  - Central bank assets (% of GDP)
  - Financial system deposits (% of GDP)
- **Coverage**: Equatorial Guinea, 1985–2019
- **Notes**: National-level data only

## 3. Method

1. Filtered the dataset for Equatorial Guinea and selected the three financial indicators.
2. **Extracted relevant columns**: Year, Indicator Name, and Value.
3. Pivoted the dataset to create a side-by-side chronological comparison of liquid liabilities, central bank assets, and financial system deposits.
4. Produced a multi-line time series plot to visualize trends, relative magnitudes, and convergence over time.

(Analysis is descriptive; no causal inference applied.)

## 4. Results

- **Liquid liabilities (% of GDP)**: Decreased significantly over the period, starting as the largest share and remaining first throughout.
- **Central bank assets (% of GDP)**: Declined substantially, initially the second-largest share, ending almost tied with financial system deposits by 2019.
- **Financial system deposits (% of GDP)**: Decreased slightly, initially the smallest share, but converged closely with the other indicators by the end of the period.
- **Comparison**: At the beginning of the period, liquid liabilities and central bank assets were over twice the size of financial system deposits. By 2019, all three indicators converged, with liquid liabilities remaining slightly highest, financial system deposits second, and central bank assets nearly tied with deposits.

## 5. Interpretation

- The initial high ratios of liquid liabilities and central bank assets relative to financial system deposits reflect a concentrated financial structure with dominant monetary authority and liquidity measures.
- Long-term declines suggest reduced reliance on central bank assets and liquid liabilities as a share of GDP, potentially indicating financial deepening, structural adjustments, or macroeconomic shifts.
- Convergence across the three indicators highlights a more balanced financial system by 2019, with less disparity between monetary and deposit measures.
- Overall, the trends point to structural change in Equatorial Guinea’s financial sector, reflecting evolving monetary management, deposit mobilization, and liquidity dynamics.

## 6. Limitations

- National-level aggregates may obscure sectoral, institutional, or regional differences in financial development.
- WDI data for earlier years may include modeled estimates, introducing uncertainty.
- The descriptive analysis does not identify causal factors behind declines or convergence in the indicators.

## 7. Next Steps / Extensions

- Investigate correlations between these financial ratios and macroeconomic growth, inflation, or fiscal policy.
- Compare Equatorial Guinea’s financial system evolution with other Central African countries to assess regional trends.
- Analyze post-2019 data to evaluate whether convergence persisted or new patterns emerged.
- Examine institutional reforms, banking sector policies, or credit expansion initiatives to explain the observed shifts.
